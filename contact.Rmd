So far, the Viridian Project consists of a single person: Markus Voge,
living in Bonn, Germany.

You can get in touch with the project using this email address:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
htmltools::HTML(paste0(htmltools::includeHTML("email.html"), "."))
```

Alternatively, you can use the
[Viridian Project community space](https://community.coinsence.org/s/viridian-project)
on the [CoinSence community platform](https://community.coinsence.org).
The CoinSence community platform is an open collaborative platform, based on

project. [HumHub](https://www.humhub.org) is a free and open source social network
