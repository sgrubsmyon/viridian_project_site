## A New World Economy {#first-section-front}

The *Viridian Project* is an attempt to implement an alternative way of economic
activity. Imagine an economy that takes into account not only economical, but also
environmental and social concerns. An economy, where people are worth more than
profits. An economy, in which **sustainable** and **fair** are the default, not the
exception.

The inspiration for the Viridian Project comes from two communities having little
contact with each other so far: The vision of the *Transition Town* movement of
a sustainable, post-fossil, resilient economy on one side. The vision of the
*cryptocurrency community* of a decentralized peer-to-peer economy on the other
side.

The main goal of the Viridian Project is to *internalize external costs* using a
new digital currency, making social and environmental concerns a normal part of
every business model. This incentivizes business that is not harmful for
society. When social peer pressure is included into economic activity (via the
alternative digital currency), people will act more responsibly automatically.
This is similar to the way that *commons* work, where a group of people
collectively cares for a common resource, making every individual act responsibly.

<!--
To achieve this, a computer network shall be implemented, in which the desired
incentives are algorithmically inherent and governed collectively by the crowd.
These algorithms mut be very carefully designed, transparent and
agreed upon by everyone. They must also be continually debated and adjusted
as soon as needed.

## Goals

The goal is to create a computer network for economic transactions that provides
the following:

* **Decentralization:** The network shall be decentralized for increased resilience.
  There should not be any single points of failure. It must also be spread to prevent
  too much concentration of power. The network shall be operated by and in the
  hands of all people, not of few (or single) corporations or governments.
* **Sustainability:** Sustainable and socially responsible business and commerce
  shall be incentivized by including external costs of economic activity
  in the prices. In addition, the cryptocurrency transactions shall not be
  verified in a resource-intensive proof-of-work process, but in an alternative
  way with an ecological footprint as small as possible.
* **Fairness:** When external costs are included in the price calculation,
  the market is fairer and closer to an idealized free market. Because the
  supply chain must be made visible, the usage of bad quality components can be
  revealed as well. Customers do not have to rely on good reputation of a
  producer, but can choose the best option available. This makes it easier for
  newcomers, accelerates the introduction of alternative technologies, thereby
  increasing innovation and reducing market monopolies.
* **Democratization:** Running on decentralized nodes, economy and society
  become more democratic and more equal, because concentration of resources and
  power can be prevented. Cryptocurrencies enable to move power away from
  centralized banks and towards the people using the currency. In addition,
  the rules of the network shall be set by the people using it, in an open,
  collaborative process, similar to the development of open source software.
* **Encryption:** The network shall be end-to-end encrypted to provide security
  and privacy. Private data shall be kept private.
* **Transparency:** It shall be visible at all times how the rules of the network
  are and *why* they are like that. Changes to the algorithms must be accompanied
  by legitimizing information. Public data shall be made open to everyone.
<!-- * **Transactions:** Economic transactions shall be performed via the network, -->
<!--   i.e. tokens of value (a currency) shall be exchanged via the network. -->


<!-- ## Tools -->

<!-- This website shall provide tools to develop the Viridian network. -->

<!-- The tools are: -->

<!-- * [**Mind Map:**](wisemapping) As a first step, brainstorming can be done with the web-based mindmapping software `wisemapping`. -->
<!-- * [**Wiki:**](wiki) More details can be given in wiki articles, including pictures, tables, and links to external resources. In the mind map, links to wiki articles can be used whenever the space in the mind map is too limited. -->


## How is this any different from what already exists?

There already are many concepts of sustainable economy, e.g.:

* Transition Towns / Permaculture
* "Gemeinwohlökonomie" (German)
* Cradle to cradle
* Öko-Bilanzierung ("Richtig rechnen - Externe Kosten internalisieren")
* True cost
* [Bioökonomie](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bio%C3%B6konomie)
* [Nachhaltige Ökonomie](http://www.nachhaltige-oekonomie.de/nachhaltige-oekonomie)
* Ecological economy
* ...

Already existing concepts of sustainable economy typically lack some or all of
the following elements described in the Daemon novels:

* **Tech:** The use of computer network technology (web, digitization, cryptocurrencies, IoT, etc.) to algorithmically enforce the rules of the new economy (whether this is feasible or not remains to be seen)
* **Coolness:** For the alternative technology to be successful, it must be cool enough to be adopted by a large (but minority) group of "early adopters". In the Daemon novels, this was achieved by addressing the gamer community and transferring concepts of comupter games to the real world.
* **Benefit:** The alternative economy will only be widely adopted if it provides real benefit for the individual. Mere moral superiority is probably not enough. In the Daemon novels, people in rural areas discover that they can earn a much better living by using the Daemon economy, while in conventional economy, they struggle to survive (e.g. farmers that need to pay large amounts to corporations like Monsanto for GMO seeds, fertilizer, and pesiticides, while not earning much with their crops on the free market).

<!-- ## New Styles -->

<!-- `html_pretty` currently supports three page themes (`cayman`, `tactile` and -->
<!-- `architect`), and two syntax highlight styles (`github` and `vignette`). -->
<!-- The theme and highlight styles can be specified in the document metadata, -->
<!-- for example: -->

<!-- ```yaml -->
<!-- output: -->
<!--   prettydoc::html_pretty: -->
<!--     theme: architect -->
<!--     highlight: github -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## Your Familiar Tools -->

<!-- Feel free to use the `knitr` infrastructure with dozens of tunable options in -->
<!-- your document. -->

<!-- ```{r fig.width=6, fig.height=6, fig.align='center'} -->
<!-- set.seed(123) -->
<!-- n <- 1000 -->
<!-- x1  <- matrix(rnorm(n), ncol = 2) -->
<!-- x2  <- matrix(rnorm(n, mean = 3, sd = 1.5), ncol = 2) -->
<!-- x   <- rbind(x1, x2) -->
<!-- head(x) -->
<!-- smoothScatter(x, xlab = "x1", ylab = "x2") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You can include code snippets of languages other than R, but note that -->
<!-- the block header has no curly brackets around the language name. -->

<!-- ```cpp -->
<!-- // [[Rcpp::export]] -->
<!-- NumericVector timesTwo(NumericVector x) { -->
<!--     return x * 2; -->
<!-- } -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You can also write math expressions, e.g. $Y = X\beta + \epsilon$, -->
<!-- footnotes^[A footnote here.], and tables, e.g. using `knitr::kable()`. -->

<!-- ```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'} -->
<!-- knitr::kable(head(iris, 10)) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## Stay Tuned -->

<!-- `prettydoc` package for latest updates and news. Comments, bug reports and -->
<!-- pull requests are always welcome. -->
