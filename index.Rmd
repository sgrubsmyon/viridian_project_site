## A New World Economy {#first-section-front}

The *Viridian Project* is an attempt to implement an alternative way of economic
activity. The new economy shall take into account not only economical, but also
environmental and social concerns. The main motivation is to have an economy
that creates strong incentives to pursue "sustainable" and "fair" business.
To achieve this, a computer network shall be implemented, in which the desired
incentives are algorithmically inherent and governed collectively by the crowd.
These algorithms mut be very carefully designed, transparent and
agreed upon by everyone. They must also be continually debated and adjusted
as soon as needed.

The main goal is to internalize external costs using a new digital currency,
making social and environmental concerns a normal part of every business model.
This would incentivize business that is not harmful for society. When social
peer pressure is included into economic activity (via the alternative digital
currency), people will act more responsibly automatically. This is similar to
the way that "commons" work, where a group of people collectively cares for a
common resource, making every individual act responsibly.

## Goals

The goal is to create a computer network that provides the following things:

* **Decentralization:** The network shall be decentralized for increased resilience.
  There shall be no single points of failure. It must also be spread to prevent
  too much concentration of power. The network shall be operated by and in the
  hands of all people, not of single (or few) corporations or governments.
* **Encryption:** The network shall be end-to-end encrpypted to provide security
  and privacy.
* **Transactions:** Economic transactions shall be performed via the network,
  i.e. tokens of value (a currency) shall be exchanged via the network.
* **Sustainability:** Sustainable and socially responsible business and commerce
  shall be incentivized, e.g. by including external costs of economic activity
  in the prices.
* **Democracy:** By the fostering of decentralized nodes, economy and society shall also become more democratic and more equal, because concentration of resources and power is (partially) prevented. In the same way as cryptocurrencies promise to move power away from centralized banks and towards the decentralized people using the currency.


## Tools

This website shall provide tools to develop the Viridian network.

The tools are:

* [**Mind Map:**](wisemapping) As a first step, brainstorming can be done with the web-based mindmapping software `wisemapping`.
* [**Wiki:**](wiki) More details can be given in wiki articles, including pictures, tables, and links to external resources. In the mind map, links to wiki articles can be used whenever the space in the mind map is too limited.


## How is this any different from what already exists?

The tools can also be used to compare different already existing concepts of sustainable economy, e.g.:

* Transition Towns / Permaculture
* Gemeinwohlökonomie
* Cradle to cradle
* Öko-Bilanzierung ("Richtig rechnen - Externe Kosten internalisieren")
* True cost
* [Bioökonomie](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bio%C3%B6konomie)
* [Nachhaltige Ökonomie](http://www.nachhaltige-oekonomie.de/nachhaltige-oekonomie)
* ...

Already existing concepts of sustainable economy typically lack some or all of the following elements described in the Daemon novels:

* **Tech:** The use of computer network technology (web, digitization, cryptocurrencies, IoT, etc.) to algorithmically enforce the rules of the new economy (whether this is feasible or not remains to be seen)
* **Coolness:** For the alternative technology to be successful, it must be cool enough to be adopted by a large (but minority) group of "early adopters". In the Daemon novels, this was achieved by addressing the gamer community and transferring concepts of comupter games to the real world.
* **Benefit:** The alternative economy will only be widely adopted if it provides real benefit for the individual. Mere moral superiority is probably not enough. In the Daemon novels, people in rural areas discover that they can earn a much better living by using the Daemon economy, while in conventional economy, they struggle to survive (e.g. farmers that need to pay large amounts to corporations like Monsanto for GMO seeds, fertilizer, and pesiticides, while not earning much with their crops on the free market).

<!-- ## New Styles -->

<!-- `html_pretty` currently supports three page themes (`cayman`, `tactile` and -->
<!-- `architect`), and two syntax highlight styles (`github` and `vignette`). -->
<!-- The theme and highlight styles can be specified in the document metadata, -->
<!-- for example: -->

<!-- ```yaml -->
<!-- output: -->
<!--   prettydoc::html_pretty: -->
<!--     theme: architect -->
<!--     highlight: github -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## Your Familiar Tools -->

<!-- Feel free to use the `knitr` infrastructure with dozens of tunable options in -->
<!-- your document. -->

<!-- ```{r fig.width=6, fig.height=6, fig.align='center'} -->
<!-- set.seed(123) -->
<!-- n <- 1000 -->
<!-- x1  <- matrix(rnorm(n), ncol = 2) -->
<!-- x2  <- matrix(rnorm(n, mean = 3, sd = 1.5), ncol = 2) -->
<!-- x   <- rbind(x1, x2) -->
<!-- head(x) -->
<!-- smoothScatter(x, xlab = "x1", ylab = "x2") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You can include code snippets of languages other than R, but note that -->
<!-- the block header has no curly brackets around the language name. -->

<!-- ```cpp -->
<!-- // [[Rcpp::export]] -->
<!-- NumericVector timesTwo(NumericVector x) { -->
<!--     return x * 2; -->
<!-- } -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You can also write math expressions, e.g. $Y = X\beta + \epsilon$, -->
<!-- footnotes^[A footnote here.], and tables, e.g. using `knitr::kable()`. -->

<!-- ```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'} -->
<!-- knitr::kable(head(iris, 10)) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## Stay Tuned -->

<!-- Please visit the [development page](http://github.com/yixuan/prettydoc/) of the  -->
<!-- `prettydoc` package for latest updates and news. Comments, bug reports and -->
<!-- pull requests are always welcome. -->
