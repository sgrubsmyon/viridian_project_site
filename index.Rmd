## A New World Economy {#first-section-front}

The *Viridian Project* is an attempt to implement an alternative way of economic
activity. Imagine an economy that takes into account not only economical, but also
environmental and social concerns. An economy, where people are worth more than
profits. An economy, in which **sustainable** and **fair** are the default, not the
exception.

The inspiration for the Viridian Project comes from two communities having little
contact with each other so far: The vision of the *Transition Town* movement of
a sustainable, post-fossil, resilient economy on one side. The vision of the
*cryptocurrency community* of a decentralized peer-to-peer economy on the other
side.

The main goal of the Viridian Project is to *internalize external costs* using a
new digital currency, making social and environmental concerns a normal part of
every business model. This incentivizes business that is not harmful for
society. When social peer pressure is included into economic activity (via the
alternative digital currency), people will act more responsibly automatically.
This is similar to the way that *commons* work, where a group of people
collectively cares for a common resource, making every individual act responsibly.

<!--
To achieve this, a computer network shall be implemented, in which the desired
incentives are algorithmically inherent and governed collectively by the crowd.
These algorithms mut be very carefully designed, transparent and
agreed upon by everyone. They must also be continually debated and adjusted
as soon as needed.

## Goals

The objective is to create a computer network for economic transactions providing
the following:

<img src="network.svg" style="height: 100px;">

#### Decentralization

The network shall be decentralized for increased resilience.
There should not be any single points of failure. It must also be spread to prevent
too much concentration of power. The network shall be operated by and in the
hands of all people, not of few (or single) corporations or governments.

#### Democratization

Running on decentralized nodes, economy and society
become more democratic and more equal, because concentration of resources and
power can be prevented. Cryptocurrencies enable to move power away from
centralized banks and towards the people using the currency. In addition,
the rules of the network shall be set by the people using it: in an open,
collaborative process, similar to the development of open source software.

#### Sustainability

Sustainable and socially responsible business and commerce
shall be incentivized by including external costs of economic activity
in the prices. In addition, the cryptocurrency transactions shall not be
verified in a resource-intensive proof-of-work process, but in an alternative
way with an ecological footprint as small as possible.

#### Privacy

The network shall be end-to-end encrypted to provide security
and privacy. People should have full control over their data.
Private data shall be kept private, instead of being a commodity,
which is harvested for profit.

#### Fairness

When external costs are included in the price calculation,
the market is fairer and closer to an idealized free market. Also, because the
supply chain can be revealed in the process, inferior quality can be revealed as
well. Customers do not have to trust the reputation of a producer, but can
choose the best option available. This makes it easier for newcomers and
accelerates the introduction of alternative technologies, thereby increasing
innovation and reducing market monopolies.

#### Transparency

It shall be visible at all times how the rules of the network
are and *why* they are like that, including the internalization of external
costs. Changes to the algorithms must be accompanied by legitimizing information.
Public data shall be made open to everyone. Because of its importance for
society, information on the external costs of ony economic activity must be
public and cannot be kept a company secret. Because people are
more important than profits, there cannot be such "investor protection".

<!-- * **Transactions:** Economic transactions shall be performed via the network, -->
<!--   i.e. tokens of value (a currency) shall be exchanged via the network. -->

<!-- ## Tools -->

<!-- This website shall provide tools to develop the Viridian network. -->

<!-- The tools are: -->

<!-- * [**Mind Map:**](wisemapping) As a first step, brainstorming can be done with the web-based mindmapping software `wisemapping`. -->
<!-- * [**Wiki:**](wiki) More details can be given in wiki articles, including pictures, tables, and links to external resources. In the mind map, links to wiki articles can be used whenever the space in the mind map is too limited. -->


## How is this any different from what already exists?

There already are many concepts of sustainable economy, e.g.:

* Transition Towns and Permaculture
* *Gemeinwohlökonomie* (German)
* Cradle to cradle
* *Öko-Bilanzierung* (German) ("Richtig rechnen - Externe Kosten internalisieren")
* True cost
* [Bioökonomie](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bio%C3%B6konomie)
* [Nachhaltige Ökonomie](http://www.nachhaltige-oekonomie.de/nachhaltige-oekonomie)
* Ecological economy
* ...

While these are very good approaches, already existing concepts of sustainable
economy typically lack some or all of the following elements:

* **Tech:** While technology alone cannot solve our problems and social
  innovation is needed, computer network technology (web, digitization,
  cryptocurrencies, IoT, etc.) has a vast potential to support or even enable
  societal transformation. For example, it can be critical to organize humans in
  a way to efficiently collaborate and exchange information. It might also be used
  to algorithmically enforce sustainability (whether this is feasible or not
  remains to be seen).
* **Coolness:** For the alternative technology to be successful, it must be "cool"
  enough to be adopted by a large (but minority) group of "early adopters".
  If the new technology "goes viral", it will spread very fast and be talked
  about a lot. This would be the first stage towards mass adoption.
  <!-- In the Daemon novels, this was achieved by addressing the gamer community and -->
  <!-- transferring concepts of comupter games to the real world. -->
* **Benefit:** The alternative economy will only be widely adopted if it provides
  real benefit for the individual. Mere moral superiority is probably not enough.
  One example might be farmers: Many farmers need to pay large amounts to corporations
  to buy seeds, fertilizers, and pesiticides, while not earning much with their
  crops on the market. If they discover that they can earn a much better living
  by using the alternative economy, both for buying goods and selling their
  produce, they will start using it. This would be the second stage towards mass
  adoption. When more and more groups of people join the new economy, eventually
  a critical mass will be reached and there will be a tipping point with a full
  transition to the new economy.

<!-- ## New Styles -->

<!-- `html_pretty` currently supports three page themes (`cayman`, `tactile` and -->
<!-- `architect`), and two syntax highlight styles (`github` and `vignette`). -->
<!-- The theme and highlight styles can be specified in the document metadata, -->
<!-- for example: -->

<!-- ```yaml -->
<!-- output: -->
<!--   prettydoc::html_pretty: -->
<!--     theme: architect -->
<!--     highlight: github -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## Your Familiar Tools -->

<!-- Feel free to use the `knitr` infrastructure with dozens of tunable options in -->
<!-- your document. -->

<!-- ```{r fig.width=6, fig.height=6, fig.align='center'} -->
<!-- set.seed(123) -->
<!-- n <- 1000 -->
<!-- x1  <- matrix(rnorm(n), ncol = 2) -->
<!-- x2  <- matrix(rnorm(n, mean = 3, sd = 1.5), ncol = 2) -->
<!-- x   <- rbind(x1, x2) -->
<!-- head(x) -->
<!-- smoothScatter(x, xlab = "x1", ylab = "x2") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You can include code snippets of languages other than R, but note that -->
<!-- the block header has no curly brackets around the language name. -->

<!-- ```cpp -->
<!-- // [[Rcpp::export]] -->
<!-- NumericVector timesTwo(NumericVector x) { -->
<!--     return x * 2; -->
<!-- } -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You can also write math expressions, e.g. $Y = X\beta + \epsilon$, -->
<!-- footnotes^[A footnote here.], and tables, e.g. using `knitr::kable()`. -->

<!-- ```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'} -->
<!-- knitr::kable(head(iris, 10)) -->
<!-- ``` -->
