# Introduction

Among the biggest problems of humanity in the 21st century are  environmental crises such as global warming, but also social crises such as inequal distribution of wealth, with some still suffering from hunger. These problems in turn are catalysts for conflicts and migration, putting entire societies under stress. Many experts say that we are pushing the Earth's systems beyond their planetary boundaries (cit Stockholm institute), and that the current lifestyle of the Global North would require more than one planet to survive in the long term (cit oxfam).

Most of these problems have to do with economic activity and the underlying monetary systems (cit Lietaer). One well-known problem is the privatization of profits, while costs, e.g. of  environmental damages, are being socialized. As a result, often small elites are becoming wealthier, while a majority's well-being is stagnating or even declining. Another result is the acceptance (also by the suffering majority) of  environmental damage as an inevitable consequence of economic activity and progress, even when it is risking to destroy the very foundation of life and when healthier alternatives are both available and financeable by society. Another problem of the prevailing monetary system is the inevitability of unlimited economic growth, which is, as many have pointed out (cit Paech, Hopkins, ...), opposed to the fact of living on a planet with limited resources. The economic growth is largely driven by the financial sector and the habit of paying interest rate and return of investment: companies acquiring money are forced to grow to reel in more than they invested and pay back their donors. For instance, this drives fossil fuel companies to ever riskier extraction practices, such as fracking, deep sea drilling or drilling in the Arctic, with sometimes catastrophic consequences (cit Klein).

# Changing the monetary system

As turned out by the Belgian economist Bernard Lietaer (cit), all of these problems might be addressed by monetary innovations. One interesting idea is the concept of  complementary currencies: Currencies that have limited validity, e.g. only in a certain geographic area or only within certain branches of economy. These currences are not to replace national or international currencies, but to complement them and thereby strengthen closed circles and reduce extreme aggregation of wealth. The idea of  complementary currencies is already actively followed by people from several groups, e.g. the Transition Towns movement (cit Hopkins) that aims to build a post-fossil, sustainable, and resilient economy and by the degrowth movement (cit Paech) that aims to put an end to unlimited economic growth. Complementary currencies are already in use at some places and prove to strengthen regional and more sustainable value generation.

Another monetary innovation are cryptocurrencies (the most popular being Bitcoin) based on a distributed ledger or blockchain, which do not require any kind of central institution like a bank (cit Nakamoto). Besides the benefit of reduced cost, a much more fascinating aspect of cryptocurrencies is that of the democratization of money. Instead of restricting the privilege of creating new money and enabling money transactions to few central banks, giving them a great deal of power, this power is distributed by giving it to a large group of relatively equal players, which everyone can join. A downside is that cryptocurrencies can only exist digitally and thus require the use of electronic devices. This creates a vulnerable dependency on  electricity and might increase resource consumption, which is not good from a sustainability perspective. On the other hand,  smartphone devices capable of digital  payment are already now almost ubiquitous, even in developing parts of the world.

Cryptocurrencies are not controlled by central institutions, banks and/or governments, i.e. individual people, but by mathematic algorithms carried out by computer software, distributed on every participant's devices. This offers several opportunities: In principle, these algorithms can be formulated in any imaginable way, enabling the easy implementation of a very different monetary system. Also, if designed properly, it might be much harder to break the rules of the currency, since computers, unlike people, are not corruptible. Especially if manipulation of a majority of devices would be necessary, then this is virtually impossible, which is also what makes Bitcoin a very secure currency.

## A new ethical cryptocurrency

The idea is to combine the aim of a more sustainable economy with the benefits of cryptocurrencies. If cryptocurrencies can be designed as one sees fit, then it might be possible to solve the problems of conventional monetary systems.

As a starting point, one can try to incorporate external costs into prices of products and services. External costs are those that are not part of the economic calculation when a price is determined, however they still arise (sometimes at a different place and/or time, harming third parties) and have to be paid by someone, usually the tax payer. Examples of external costs are health damages caused by pollution or costs of disasters that are the result of careless extraction of resources, including more frequent extreme weather events as a result of green house gas emissions. In order to ensure that external costs are taken care of ad well as discourage harmful and encourage sustainable behavior, it is better to internalize external costs into the actual price.

## Two-dimensional money

The problem is that a (traditional) currency system cannot directly influence the way a business owner determines prices. The currency as a whole can be valued up our down by increasing or reducing the amount of fresh money (i.e. setting the key interest rate), but that does not influence individual trades. However, cryptocurrencies basically consist of transactions between peers and may offer a possibility to interfere right there. A possible idea is to add another dimension to money.

Ever since the invention of money, it has been one-dimensional in its very nature, the single dimension being value, or rather quantity. Digital currencies might remove this restriction and could add other dimensions to quantity, for example quality. Not only the mere amount of (physical) wealth would matter, but also the change in quality of life that comes along with the aggregation of wealth.

To make it more visual, one can think of the new dimension as color: From green, indicating good quality, to red, indicating bad quality. For means of computation, color can be converted to a number between -1 (red) and +1 (green). Since it would be complicated to handle real 2D money (e.g. adding or subtracting money involves vector calculus, which is simple, but not convenient for many people), the color should only come into play during a transaction. When money enters the wallet (both the seller's and the buyer's), it is automatically projected onto a single axis. This means that red money is valued down, while green money is valued up, which corresponds to a diagonal movement in the 2D money space.

It can be argued how exactly this projection should be done, e.g. in a linear or non-linear way. It is also debatable if there should be upper and lower limits to the de-/revaluation and what these limits should be. To avoid too extreme value changes, the effect of the color on the transaction should be considered when the color is determined. For now, a very simplistic choice is made: A color $c$ of a transaction changes the value of the reserved money by factor $1 + c$, which can lie anywhere between 0 (dark red, complete devaluation, i.e. selling is prohibited) and 2 (dark green, i.e. duplication of value). This means that there is also "neutral money", which is yellow, $c = 0$, that does not change value, $1 + c = 1$. So, the price $p$ paid by the buyer is changed into the seller's yield $y$ via:

$$ y = (1 + c) p $$

It is also an interesting question whether there should be more up or more down valuation, which would essentially either create or destroy money, or whether they should balance each other. Currently in use mainstream currencies constantly create new money out of nothing via credits, which creates a low inflation rate. Keeping in mind other ways of new money generation, this has to be kept in mind when designing the new currency.

As a concrete example, buying an emission-intensive car with a fossil fuel burning engine might involve red money, while an emission-free electric vehicle is bought with green money. 

Let's assume that the seller of the red money car had to pay 9,000 coins to buy the car from the producer. The car seller needs a profit margin of 1,000 coins, so would sell it for 10,000 coins without considering color. The color of the transaction is -0.5, meaning that the yield $y$ will come out 50% lower than the price $p$. For $y$ to be 10,000, $p$ must be $p = y / (1 + c)$, so the car must be sold for 20,000 coins.

On the other hand, the green car seller might have paid 15,000 coins to the producer and wants to earn 1,000 coins as well. The color is 0.1, translating into a price of $16,000/1.1 = 14,545.45$ coins, making the car cheaper for the consumer even though it was more costly to produce.

Upon entering the seller's wallet, the red money loses some of its value, while the green money is valued up. This effectively means that the fossil fuel car will be sold with a higher price (since the seller gains less), while the electric car gets cheaper. It is like a higher tax on one, while subsidizing the other. The buyer does not even need to know about the color of the transaction or the process of (de-)valuation, only the seller needs to include the color into her price calculation. This makes it easier to adopt for the consumer. This can help cleaner, emerging technologies, sometimes needed as quick as possible from an ecological point of view, to become marketable much quicker. It can create the right incentives to make good investments and use good practices, while punishing behavior that is harmful to the general public.

It is important to note that, similar to value added tax, the colorization should probably not be applied multiple times, but only at the end consumer. Intermediate reevaluations must be undone accordingly.

## Redistribution of value

The red money transactions may take a part of the buyer's money and pay it into a fund to alleviate side-effect damages like environmental disasters or increased health costs and can also fund dedicated projects supporting unemployed people during structural change. This would adhere to the principle "the polluter pays" (cit Klein) and would be considered fair by most people.

All transactions regardless of color should include a small transaction fee that is paid to the color determiners to reward them for their services.

## Managed by the crowd

While a similar effect to that of colored money can be reached by taxation and subsidization, the interesting aspect is that a cryptocurrency offers a possibility to do this without a central authority involved. The main problem of transforming the economy towards sustainable development is to do it in a way that is fair and socially accepted by everyone. 

Past policies have failed to do so. The less wealthy will not accept a change that feels like they have to give up their standard of living, while the wealthiest, the ones most responsible, e.g. those profiting from extraction of resources, are not taken into account. The fear of losing jobs due to a necessary system change is quickly sparked in the public and surely must be addressed, e.g. by dedicated projects. But because governance fails to introduce such projects, which should be paid for by polluters like the fossil fuel companies, system change never comes.

This is why such important decisions like the color of money cannot be placed into the hand of a few privileged, or even a single person. It must be done collaboratively by the crowd, in a way that is acceptable by everyone.

The concept here is different, bypassing government and any centralized institutions or elites: Like the Bitcoin miners perform the service of validating transactions and keeping the currency network secure, dedicated decentralized groups could determine the transaction colors. Much like developers of open source software, there could be groups of people dedicated to auditing certain products or producers in terms of sustainability. Collaboratively, they determine the color in an open and transparent way. There should be an online platform, much like a "Github of the economy", where the color determination takes place and is documented. Every interested individual can view how the decision on color was reached and can make suggestions, even though only few have the required experience and the time to actually make decisions.

## The hard problem of finding color

Determining a fair color for virtually every product or service that can be bought seems like such a collosal task that it might well be deemed impossible. It might mean performing audits similar to what is done currently for products to obtain certain labels on sustainability or fair trade, but not for free specific products, but for everything. On the other hand, there already exist software tools and databases for performing lifecycle analyses (LCA), which can be leveraged to estimate products' environmental impact, an important part of the color determination. Also, if products consist of components, then the color can partly be a composite. If the same components are used in other products, one can re-use their color.

But still, several problems come to mind: One is the question how the transition to the new currency might be done, a classical hen-egg-problem. If the currency is not in wide use, only very few products will have an adequate color. This means only few products can be bought with the new currency in a meaningful way, which might attract few adopters.

Another problem is that of scalability: while it is in principle possible to determine color, it is very hard to do this completely, for every product. Of course, it can always only be a best guess, but one should at least take a closer look, which takes time. A lot of manpower is required to do the audits, which might need to include travels and on-site visits. Some might argue that the work of the auditors would be so expensive that it would be hard for society to pay for it. On the other hand, it should be questioned if an ethical fair economy might be worth the price. However, any idea to simplify the color determination process and save (human) resources as much as possible would be very welcome.

A third problem is that of changing time: The color of a product can never be constant, but must continuously adapt and react to changes in the production. This is important, also to reward producers when they improve, to create good incentives.

A fourth problem is that one must make sure that the system is not corrupted or gamed. Of course, there will be strong motivation to come out "as green as possible", so producers will "do their best", both on legal and illegal paths. The transparency of making all color decisions public on a Github-like platform might help, but probably will not be enough.

## Attracting a critical mass

If the general public is ever to embrace this new technology, it is immensely important to make it attractive not only to a few people hat are both tech-savvy and care about the planet.

One strategy could be to create a subculture that identifies with this new technology as part of their lifestyle. To make the connection stronger, one could make use of good design, e.g. a very smart name, a fitting logo and a "cool"-looking user interface. The subculture embracing the new technology could cause the public to talk about this new phenomenon, raising more and more interest. Eventually, the subculture may blend into the mainstream and become part of everyone's lives.

However, more important than good-looking design will be usability: ease of use on one hand (paying with the app must be as intuitive as writing a text message), and a perceived gain on the other hand. If the new technology can buy you nothing you can buy with your trusted currency already, and if prices are even higher, then the average customer will not use it, no matter how "sustainable" it is. There must be some advantages to using it. For example, if a new economy would be built around it, there might be products (perhaps highly sought-after innovations) that are only sold in the new currency.

Another interesting strategy would be to create a parallel economy that has as many closed circles as possible for the new currency. This is the concept followed by most complementary currencies. Apart from the new currency enabling access to this somewhat "privileged club", its use might also have economic advantages. If the alternative currency has more value inside these closed circles than the conventional currency of the outside world, then people will choose to use it. Especially in times of financial crises troubling conventional currencies. This is what happened in the Wörgl experiment, for instance (cit Wörgl).

It is obvious that it is very important to find early adopters not only among buyers, but even more so among sellers: i.e. producers and merchants (and corresponding auditors). Only if one can buy things, buyers can start using it. Naturally, small companies that already today care a lot about sustainability might be the first adopters. Companies that would be forced to change their behavior will only join when they absolutely have to if they want to survive.

# Conclusion

Leveraging the wisdom of crowds and the power of cryptocurrencies, perhaps one can reach a societal consensus towards a world that is more worth living in for everyone, preserving life for future generations, while not giving up modern lifestyles.

These are the requirements that must be fulfilled by the alternative currency:

1. It must feature a significantly more sustainable and/or fair economy.
2. It must be based on societal consensus to be accepted by (almost) everyone.
3. It must be very easy to use.
4. It must be fun to use and/or provide a real advantage.
5. It must be relatively hard to break the rules or abuse the system.

I assume that (1) would be a consequence of all the other points fulfilled, if the currency would be designed similar to what is described above. (2) is the main problem remaining to be solved: how to determine the external costs of goods in a socially acceptable way. The idea to use crowdsourcing was only vaguely described here. More thoughts on this would be greatly appreciated. (5) would only partly be fulfilled by the use of cryptocurrencies, how to secure the crowdsourcing against abuse is another problem to be solved. (3) and (4) have only been merely touched on the surface.

Therefore, we are still at the very beginning, but I hope that something good will evolve out of this.
