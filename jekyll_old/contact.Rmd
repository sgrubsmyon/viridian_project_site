## {#first-section}

So far, the Viridian Project consists of a single person: Markus Voge,
living in Bonn, Germany. I am looking for like-minded people to discuss and
exchange ideas. **I would like to get feedback from as many people as possible**,
especially on the topics listed under the tiles on the
[start page](index.html#get-involved).

You can reach the project at this email address:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
htmltools::HTML(paste0(htmltools::includeHTML("email.html"), "."))
```

Alternatively, you can use the
[Viridian Project community space](https://community.coinsence.org/s/viridian-project)
on the [CoinSence community platform](https://community.coinsence.org).
The CoinSence community platform is an open collaborative platform, based on
[HumHub](https://www.humhub.org), hosted by the [CoinSence](http://coinsence.org/)
project. [HumHub](https://www.humhub.org) is a free and open source social network
software.
