Viridian Project
================
  
Idea
----
  
Encrypted computer network as base for alternative economy, which is
more sustainable, fair, and democratic. Shift of power from corporations
to people, from centralized to decentralized, from oligarchy to
democracy, from exploitation to solidarity.

Concept of Transition Towns implemented using a computer network.

Role model: novels written by Daniel Suarez called "Daemon" and "Freedomâ„¢".

I think what might be new is the connection between the transition idea
and cryptocurrencies (e.g. bitcoin). Both communities want to have more
democratic, decentralized structures, but they are not connected with
each other. Even in the Daemon novels, cryptocurrencies are not
mentioned, only automation, computer networks and computer games. This
might be because bitcoin is younger than the novels.

  strenghtening democracy, and improving education.

Currency
--------
  
There needs to be one (or many) alternative currencies. This is because
the value of products and services shall be calculated differently. The
new currency will have different value than the old. People must find a
value surplus in the new currency for some products, or maybe some
products can be bought only with the new currency,  therefore
encouraging people to use the new  currency. Also, money created in the
Viridian economy shall not leave the system, but be reinvested within. The
same is used in the Transition Town initiatives, e.g. the Totnes Pound.
The currency shall be electronic and be used within the Viridian network.
Maybe a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin could be used.


Bitcoin
-------
  
Interesting electronic (crypto)currency. Also called "digital cash" or
"digital gold". It is decentralized, therefore interesting for the
Viridian project.  Bitcoin, or rather the blockchain, which is a public
database of all bitcoin transactions, can be used for other things as
well, e.g. for authentication. One could also use it for democratic
voting. One of the most interesting features is that the independency
and decentralization is kind of built into the system: because the
confirmation of transactions needs computing power, which is (resource)
expensive, one would need to set up more than half of the computing
power of all bitcoin hubs to outvote the majority of hubs and therefore
manipulate bitcoin. A similar built-in instrument would be needed to
e.g. ensure that sustainability and social rules are enforced within the
Viridian economy, or rather to include external costs into the prices.
Maybe swarm intelligence/crowd could be used to do this? One needs to
find a stable optimum that is robust against manipulations and is
democratic and in the interest of the community.  Even though the
majority's interest should be followed (democracy), one needs to make
sure that  minorities are not discriminated, but their interests are
protected.

Pros of Bitcoin:

+ Decentralized
+ Robust against manipulation

Cons of Bitcoin:

- Very resource intensive (bitcoin network needs as much energy as Ireland)
- Does not scale well (blockchain can get too large)

Prices
------

A fundamental difference to conventional economy is that in the Viridian
economy, costs created by environmental or social exploitation and
damage, i.e. external costs, should be included in product prices.
Consequently, unsustainable solutions will automatically be disfavoured
as they're less economic. In the Daemon novel, credit points/levels are
used like in a role playing computer game. More sustainable and
resilient solutions are given more credit/level rating, e.g. the solar
hydrogen economy of a native American community. How the internalization
of external costs should be implemented in general for every product and
service is one of the central problems to be solved.

Democracy
---------
  
Political decisions should involve citizens to use swarm/crowd
intelligence.  This might be done using electronic forums where people
can post suggestions that others can up/downvote or edit, i.e. post new
suggestions. A similar tool, Findeco, was developed by the German pirate
party, but it did not work well because of too low
participation/involvement. It must be thought about how to involve
people and encourage them to contribute to the political process because
swarm intelligence only works with large numbers of individuals.

Local Workshops
---------------
  
Economy should as much as possible be decentralized to be resilient, to
reduce environmental impact and be affordable by locals because there
are no currency exchange rates/taxes/transportation costs involved. For
a decentralized industry, there could be local workshops with 3D
printing and similar automated technology to manufacture also more
complicated goods without the need for specialized machinery or
engineering knowledge. Local raw materials should be used as much as
possible.
